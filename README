chunkdl - Download split files as a whole

These scripts were written in order to circumvent file size restrictions many
free webhosters impose on their plans to limit traffic and prevent users from
storing large amounts of non-website data, which is inconvenient if you want
to offer just a few files that are over the limit.
That said, please use these scripts to do good, not evil.

Your PHP installation needs to support readfile() and Perl-compatible Regular
Expressions (PCRE) -- most do so.

Note that the maximum chunk size (and therefore total file size) is not only
limited by disk quotas, but also by the PHP memory limit and, to a lesser
degree, by the maximum script execution time.

Patches are accepted via mail, preferably as generated by `git format-patch`.
